## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

[Provide a brief description of your system architecture. You should include a diagram image here and describe the main components and their interactions]

**Main Components:**

1. **[Component Name]**: [Brief description of responsibility]
2. **[Component Name]**: [Brief description of responsibility]
3. **[Component Name]**: [Brief description of responsibility]

### Data Flows

[Describe how data flows through your system - from user input to final output/notification]

#### Data Flow 1
1. User scans QR code
2. Request sent to backend API
3. Message published to RabbitMQ/Kafka
4. Consumer processes message and updates database
5. Real-time notification sent to relevant users

---

### Simulations and Simplifications

[Explain what aspects were simulated or simplified for the proof-of-concept]

Example:
- QR code scanning simulated using manual code input
- GPS coordinates replaced with predefined location data
- Mobile app replaced with responsive web interface
